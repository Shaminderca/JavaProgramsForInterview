A Stack is a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure. It supports two basic operations called push and pop.
The push operation adds an element at the top of the stack, and the pop operation removes an element from the top of the stack.
The Stack class extends Vector which implements the List interface. A Vector is a re-sizable collection. 
It grows its size to accommodate new elements and shrinks the size when the elements are removed.
push : Add element on the top of the stack
pop :  Remove element from the top of the stack
peek:  It does not remove the element but only return the element from the top.
